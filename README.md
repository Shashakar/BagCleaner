`/bc clean` or `/bagclean clean` will prompt to confirm the delete, allowing you to list the items before deletion to better confirm whether or not you want to use bag clean.

`/bc ignore [itemLink]` or `/bagclean ignore [itemLink]` will add an item to the ignore list. These items won't be considered for deletion.

`/bc unignore [itemLink]` or `/bagclean unignore [itemLink]` will remove an item to the ignore list.
